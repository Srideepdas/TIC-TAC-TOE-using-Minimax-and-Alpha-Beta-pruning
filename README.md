# TIC-TAC-TOE-using-Minimax-and-Alpha-Beta-pruning
This paper proposed an intuitive implementation of the MINIMAX algorithm followed by Alpha-Beta pruning to reduce the search space for tic-tac-toe game 
using 3x3 grid structure. The back-pedal algorithm is used in option choosing from combinations of several alternatives, 
to achieve better understating of Artificial Intelligence (AI) work in game playing. 
Later Alpha-Beta pruning equalized the minimax algorithm. It returns the same moves, however,
removes all the branches that will not be affecting the final part of the game. The implementation is based on 3x3 grids for game.
In future this work can further be extended to 4x4 or 5x5 to increase the complexity of the algorithm.
We observed that there is no player won the game against the computer (opponent).
